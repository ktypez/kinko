# Deployment

Kinko separates **source** from **runtime**: edit this repo, deploy a clean
copy to a service root, and let systemd manage it.

## Source vs. service root

- Source (this repo): `~/projects/kinko`
- Service root (default): `~/.local/share/kinko`
- Data lives in `$KINKO_SERVICE_ROOT/data` and is **never** touched by
  `deploy.sh`.

## Deploy

```bash
./deploy.sh                  # rsyncs source → service root (excl. .git, venv cache, data)
# then manage the service:
sudo systemctl restart kinko
```

`deploy.sh` also installs the `vaultctl` CLI onto `~/.local/bin` and symlinks
it into `~/.opencode/bin`, so a single deploy updates both the service and the
client.

## Service management

```bash
sudo systemctl status kinko
sudo systemctl stop kinko
sudo systemctl restart kinko
journalctl -u kinko -f
```

The installed unit runs from the service root with `VAULT_DATA_DIR` pointed at
its own `data/` directory, so the production service never executes out of a
dev checkout.

## Backups

`credentials.enc` is fully encrypted — safe to copy into any backup system.
Restore = drop the file back into `data/` and restart. Lose both the file
*and* the master password and there is no recovery path.

`audit.jsonl` is plain JSONL (no secrets) and can be backed up or rotated
freely.
